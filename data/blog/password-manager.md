I have used password managers for about four years, and I have benefited greatly from not worrying about “If I remember the username and the corresponding password”.

I can confidently create different and random passwords for different accounts with password managers. “Different passwords” mean that when a hacker hacks a website I registered, I just need to change the password of the account registered on that website and don’t need to worry that the hacker will use the username and password to login into other websites I have registered. The range of my accounts hacked is limited to only one. And “random passwords” mean it will take a hacker longer to crack my passwords(usually, the passwords stored in databases are encrypted.), even if they have dumped the whole database.

The password manager I used is BitWarden. Besides using it to generate random passwords and store passwords, I also use it to generate random usernames to prevent someone malicious from searching my profiles on different websites.
