I am a law school student. There are a lot of codes I need remember. But I have a poor momory. So I have to search for codes(codes of law). Law databases are good, but they are difficult to access. So I built a wiki for myself to store the codes I need, and the wiki is easy to access. 

You can access the wiki by [this link](https://wiki.harveyqiu.xyz/).
