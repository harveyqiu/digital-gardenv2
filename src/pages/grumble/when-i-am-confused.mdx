- Before you jump into learning anything new, you must answer three critical questions: 1. “Why must I learn this?” 2. “How can I use this?” 3. “When can I use this?”
- Have a clear why, how, and when before diving into any topic. This will help you build a strategic learning map to learn more efficiently.
- The brain is not good at holding raw information (equation, concepts, theorems) but extremely good at learning [through](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0010028574900085) vivid imagery and emotions.
- Make a Not-To-Do List: > To learn faster and better, you must do the work with the highest returns. A great way is to make a list of tasks that you __should not prioritise__. This will help you focus on the most valuable work and avoid what doesn’t matter.
- For example, many tasks that seem urgent, such as replying to emails and attending meetings, are not crucial to your learning goals. Such work only gives you a fake sense of productivity but doesn’t help you make real progress.
- Do the work with the highest value; even if it’s the least comfortable, you’ll reap the most remarkable results in the long run.
- Lousy practise never leads to mastery.     Rather: “Perfect practice makes perfect.” — Jim Kwik.
- According to Jim Kwik, your most valuable asset is not time; it’s __attention__. It doesn’t matter whether you have a thousand years if you waste them doing lazy work. That’s why working with intensity and heightened attention is key to fast progress. Practice your learning with __intensity and focus__; you’ll reap extraordinary results in the long run.
- Remove chaos from your life:  1. Clear your mind: mindfulness, gratitude, letting go. 2. Clear your physical space: keep a minimalist and tidy space. 3.  Clear your digital space: organise your emails and files in folders with all-caps names. 4. Clear your social life: ditch people dragging you down.
