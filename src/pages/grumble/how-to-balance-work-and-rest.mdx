Sometimes it's difficult to balance work time with rest time. We'd like to work more and rest less since we have limited time.


When does the Pomodoro technique work?

understanding the principle behind the Pomodoro technique

attention residue

a portion of brain resources is used to prevent yourself from distraction

- Beginning - Optimised (clean cache)
- During - Reduce Distraction (arbitrary time)
- End - Clean & Intentional

the limitation of the Pomodoro technique is that it doesn't talk much about the break.

50% focus (when you feel yourself working slower)
if we are burned out, it will take more time for us to recover to the optimal state

more work, less break

**break time = 1/4 to 1/3 of the work time**


没有必要强迫自己工作/学习25分钟之后休息5分钟
1. 25分钟可能并不够进入心流状态
2. 25分钟的工作时间过于固定，对于不同程度的工作，25分钟可能会过于轻松或者过于劳累
3. 休息时间太少了，完全可以休息到自己觉得自己恢复状态再继续
4. 


how to recover during the break time 
- scrolling through Instagram exhausts us


1. set micro-goals
2. time your work
3. calculate the break time according to the time you worked
4. rest intentionally 
    5. if tired, just mediate
    6. or doing something maintains flow state
        7. go for a stroll
    8. scrolling Twitter is a "bad" break
  
not sticking to a very rigid work/rest time
